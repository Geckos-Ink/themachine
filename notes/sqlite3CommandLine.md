Yes, you can execute SQLite select queries using the command line in Linux. SQLite provides a command-line tool called `sqlite3` that allows you to interact with SQLite databases from the terminal. Here's how you can execute a select query:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where your SQLite database file is located. If you don't have it yet, you can create a new SQLite database using the following command:

   ```bash
   sqlite3 mydatabase.db
   ```

   Replace `mydatabase.db` with the name you want to give to your database file.

3. Once you have the database file or you're inside the SQLite shell, you can execute a select query. For example, if you have a table named `mytable` and you want to select all rows from it, you can do the following:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mytable;
   ```

   If you're already inside the SQLite shell, you can start typing the SQL query directly. If you're in the terminal but not in the SQLite shell, you can execute the query by running:

   ```bash
   sqlite3 mydatabase.db "SELECT * FROM mytable;"
   ```

   Replace `mydatabase.db` with the actual name of your database file.

4. Press Enter, and you'll see the result of the select query displayed in the terminal.

Here's an example of how it might look in the terminal:

```bash
$ sqlite3 mydatabase.db
SQLite version 3.36.0 2021-06-18 18:36:39
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

sqlite> SELECT * FROM mytable;
1|John|Doe
2|Jane|Smith
3|Bob|Johnson
```

In this example, we're inside the SQLite shell, but you can also execute the query directly from the terminal, as shown earlier.
